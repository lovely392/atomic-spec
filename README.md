  <strong>An AI-native methodology for living requirements — one atom, one file, one unit of knowledge.</strong>
</p>

Atomic Spec is an **AI-native** methodology that unifies **Domain-Driven Design**, **Test-Driven Development**, **Use-Case-Driven**, and **Requirements-Driven** approaches into a single flow orchestrated by AI agents. Every requirement is a living artifact with history, not a frozen document.

## Core Idea

Every requirement lives in a single `*.spec.md` file (an "atom") that progresses through three **AI agent roles**:

**Analyst Agent** (business intent) → **Developer Agent** (implementation) → **Tester Agent** (verification)

An **Orchestrator Agent** coordinates the pipeline, switches roles, and validates artifacts at each **Gate** checkpoint. The entire workflow — from decomposition to code to tests — is driven by AI agents following strict contracts.

## Key Principles

- **AI-native**: three specialized AI agents (Analyst, Developer, Tester) orchestrated by a meta-agent
- **One atom = one file = one unit of knowledge** (`*.spec.md`)
- **Progressive disclosure**: from business intent to test cases and code
- **Technology agnostic core**: the heart of an atom is platform-independent
- **Traceability**: every artifact references its source atom
- **Contract-based agent pipeline**: each agent role produces artifacts, validated at gates

## Atom Hierarchy

```
System                          <- changes once in a product's lifetime
 └── Domain (Bounded Context)   <- changes on strategic shifts
      └── Use Case              <- changes almost every sprint
           └── Scenario (leaf)  <- atomic test case
```

## Quick Start

1. Copy `templates/atom-template.spec.md` to your project's `specs/` directory
2. Fill in the Analyst sections (Intent, Domain Rules, AC, DMT, Constraints)
3. Pass Gate A validation
4. Fill in Developer sections (Tech Spec, Platform API, Implementation Notes)
5. Pass Gate B validation
6. Fill in Tester sections (Test Plan, Platform Tests, Coverage Matrix)
7. Pass Gate C validation

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for a detailed walkthrough.

## AI Agent Orchestrator

Atomic Spec is designed to be executed by AI agents. The included **Orchestrator Skill** for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) drives the full pipeline:

1. **Decomposes** a task into atoms (spec files)
2. **Switches** between Analyst → Developer → Tester agent roles
3. **Validates** artifacts at each Gate before passing to the next role
4. **Follows** git conventions for branches, commits, and PRs

Install the skill and your AI agent becomes a full Atomic Spec practitioner. See [`skill/`](skill/) directory and [installation instructions](skill/README.md).

```
You: "Design a user registration feature"

Orchestrator: Decomposes → domain AUTH, type additive
  [ROLE: Analyst]    → Intent, Domain Rules, AC, Constraints → Gate A ✅
  [ROLE: Developer]  → Tech Spec, API, Code                 → Gate B ✅
  [ROLE: Tester]     → Test Plan, Coverage Matrix, Tests     → Gate C ✅
Done: spec + code + tests, all traced to atoms.
```

## Meta-Specification

This repository eats its own dog food — the methodology itself is described using Atomic Spec format in the [`specs/`](specs/) directory. See [`specs/system.spec.md`](specs/system.spec.md) as the entry point.

## The Methodology Test

> Can you reconstruct the complete domain history — who, when, why made each decision — only from `git log` on `*.spec.md` files? **Yes** → methodology applied correctly.
